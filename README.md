# 🧠 OpenCV Basics in Python

Welcome to the **OpenCV Basics** repository! 👁️‍🗨️  
This repo contains beginner-friendly Python scripts demonstrating fundamental concepts of **OpenCV**, a powerful open-source computer vision library.

Whether you're just starting out with OpenCV or looking for simple examples to brush up your skills, this collection is a great place to begin.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each script is focused on a single concept or feature of OpenCV. Examples include:

- Image loading and display
- Drawing shapes and text
- Color space conversions
- Image transformations (resize, rotate, crop)
- Video capture from webcam
- Edge detection and filters
- Contour detection
- Face detection using Haar Cascades

More will be added as the repository grows!

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run these scripts, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy (used in some scripts)

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```
